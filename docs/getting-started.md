# Getting Started

## Where to Start?

Welcome to the Equicord documentation! This guide will help you get started with installing and using Equicord.

## What is Equicord?

**Equicord** is a Vencord fork that is actively maintained and updated by the Equicord team and contributors with over 300+ plugins. You can find our additional plugins [here](https://equicord.org/plugins).

**Equibop** is a standalone Discord client with Equicord pre-installed. No need to patch your existing Discord installation.
