## 🏭/🏗️ Installing Userplugins

Equicord supports any plugin to be built into your Discord (including 3rd-party plugins from Vencord). To install a user plugin, follow these steps:

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT

To install userplugins, Equicord needs to be built from source. See [here](https://docs.equicord.org/building-from-source) for more info.

### 1. ⏬ Download the Plugin

#### ✅ Correct:

```plaintext
src/userplugins/MyMagicPlugin.ts
src/userplugins/MyMagicPlugin/index.tsx
```

#### ⚠️ Incorrect:

```plaintext
src/userplugins/MyMagicPlugin/MyMagicPlugin/MyMagicPlugin.tsx
src/userplugins/index.ts
```

### 2. 📥 Place Plugin in Userplugins Folder

After downloading, place the plugin file in one of these locations:

- **Windows:** `Equicord\src\userplugins\`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Equicord/src/userplugins/`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/Equicord/src/userplugins/`

### 3. 🔃 Restart Discord

Restart Discord completely for the plugin to take effect. You can then enable it in Equicord settings.

## 🏗️🏭 Extras

This documentation is currently unfinished. If you would like to contribute to Equicord, open a PR [here](https://github.com/Equicord/EquiDocs/pulls/).

### 1. "My Plugin isn't working!"

Make sure the plugin is in the correct folder and has the correct file structure. If you're still having issues, check the Equicord build logs for more information.

### 2. Where do I get support about Plugin Development?

For plugin development suggestions/support, you can ask in the Equicord Discord. You may not get a reply if the user or person is not knowledgeable on the topic.
