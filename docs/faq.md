## 3. "Something went wrong. Please check the logs above."

This could be Windows Defender blocking Equicord's CLI installer. Please disable or add an exclusion. Learn how to add an exclusion [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/671233/how-to-add-exclusions-in-windows-defender-on-windows-10/).

## 4. "Discord Activities aren't working!"
